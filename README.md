## Description

Our goal is to provide an introduction and overview of the Python programming
language and ecosystem, including the base python language features and some
libraries which are widely used both inside and outside of astronomy.

We will be using [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks throughout, which are
a great tool to interactively write python code, and easily do things such as
plotting and visualization all in one place.

We have some info on installing python, along with an introductory jupyter
notebook to cover some basics, which are linked in the 'Before the Workshop'
section below. Along with these introductory concepts, we will introduce you to:

- The python ecosystem, and jupyter notebooks.
- The basic libraries of numerical and scientific computing, NumPy and SciPy.
- How to visualize and plot data using matplotlib
- Libraries for easily working with data, such as Pandas.

We hope for this workshop to be a springboard from which you can learn much more
about python, programming and working with software in astronomy and the
sciences.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain awareness of Jupyter notebook - a tool that can help you organize
  research notes and code in one place.
- Obtain basic proficiency in popular python packages frequently used in
  astronomy research.

## Agenda

We have included excellent and thorough materials from the 2020 edition of this
workshop, which you may find useful. The `ipynb` files can be found in the
`2020_materials` folder.

### Day 1

- Introduction to the Anaconda + Python + Jupiter ecosystem.
- Use Google Colab to attain basic familiarity with Python syntax and features.
- Introduction to NumPy.
- notebook: `day1.ipynb` [(Google Colab version)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JZdyfnAu-A7pWduS59Uo3lKpiJNGEmKV?usp=sharing)

### Day 2

- Introduction to a few more major scientific computing libraries:
    - `matplotlib`
    - `scipy`
    - `astropy`
    - `sympy`
- `day2.ipynb` or the [Google Colab
  version](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OlX2-L5KZxhuHjrHuKLKm1zCgHsT2iq4?usp=sharing))

### Day 3

- Setting up local environment
- Working from the command line
- PyCharm and Anaconda
- Goal: run the script [here](day3/day3_classExample.py) on your local computer.

## *Before* the workshop

If you would like to follow along interactively during the workshop, please do
the following before the course starts:

- Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (official
  installation instructions are
  [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)). Use the latest version
  of Python 3 and be sure to check the box that says "Add Anaconda to my PATH
  environment variable" if on Windows.

- Please go through the notebook
  [CrashCourseInPython.ipynb](intro/CrashCourseInPython.ipynb) in the 'intro'
  folder. It will help you review the basic functionalities and concepts within
  Python.
- The CrashCourseInPython.ipynb file is a Jupyter notebook: an open-source web
  application that allows one to create and share documents that contain live
  code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It comes pre-installed
  with package distributions like Anaconda. However, if you don't have access to
  Jupyter/Python on your computer (or run into issues installing
  Anaconda/Python), you can find an online interactive version of the notebook
  [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yubo56/2021-workshop/blob/master/2020_materials/intro/CrashCourseInPython.ipynb)!
