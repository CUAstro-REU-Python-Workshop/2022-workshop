# Resources for Scientific Programming in Python


## General resources for Python
 - [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)


## NumPy, Scipy, and general scientific Python
 - [NumPy quickstart](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html)
 - [The Python Data Science Handbook by Jake
   VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)


## Resources for debugging/answering "how do I do X?" questions
 - [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
 - [Stack Exchange Network](https://stackexchange.com/)
   - [Astronomy Stack Exchange](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/)
   - [Software Engineering Stack Exchange](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/)
   - [Code Review Stack Exchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/)
   - [Data Science Stack Exchange](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/)
   - [Computational Science Stack Exchange](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/)
 - A Note on these sites: make sure you read the rules and guidelines if posting your own question. You can also use a search engine like Google to scrape for answers to a question you have. As example queries:
   - `site:stackoverflow.com numpy how to append to arrays`
   - `site:stackexchange.com numpy interpolation accuracy`
   - `site:stackoverflow.com AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'encode'`
   - Often even just searching `python how do I do X stack exchange` will bring up relevant results


## Command-Line
